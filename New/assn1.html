    <h3>About the Book</h3>
    <p>Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by J.K. Rowling1. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry1. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard2. Thus, he attends Hogwarts to practice magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger2.</p>
    <h3>Why I Love It</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The most common reason is that they promote witchcraft, but if you define witchcraft as the evil things Halloween witches are said to do, then "Harry Potter"does the opposite.</li><br/>
        <li>It follows themes such as racism and prejudice in ways that make it easier for people to hear.</li><br/>
        <li> The books are strewn with examples of all kinds of love.</li><br/>
        <li>First and foremost, it teaches readers to stand up for what they believe in, even if the world is against them.</li>
    </ol>
